Assignments:

1. Implement the functions in Model.py for a working version of Logicstic Regression Model

   During the model implementation, for gradient descent, you can choose any of the following:
     a. fmin_tnc method imported in the python file.
     b. your own implementation of gradient descent method based on the steps in the lecture.

2. Implement main.py, which does following things:
   a. Load the input data from data/data.csv
   b. Run the logistic regression using the Model you implemented, and print out the accurary
   c. Run the logistic regression using the Model in sklearn package, and print out the accurary
